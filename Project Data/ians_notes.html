      There are several tools the developers use to create web pages and to, in a way,<br>

      The "boxes" on a webpage that contain content coorelate to the indentation
      in the HTML document. The outermost "boxes" are to the far left, every "box"
      within another is indented to the right. The farther to the right code is
      indented, the deeper within the "box" it is.

       Avoiding Repetition

     <span class="concept-desc">
       Avoiding repetition is crucial to programmers for multiple reasons.
     </span>
     <p>
       When repetition is not avoided, it can cause programmers to do the same thing
       over and over. Repeating the same style into multiple html elements rather than
       grouping them into CSS classes can greatly increase the chance of code errors. Consistency is important and its much easier to achieve consistant style when
       not repeating code over and over for each similar element. Instead, using CSS, we can apply consistent style to pages without repeating code.

       Cascading Style Sheets
     </span>
     <p>
       CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language used to give style to
       html. Using classes, we declare an html element to be a css class and apply style to all elements that share the same class. Thus avoiding having to style
       each element individually.

      There are man different types of machines out there and most are designed
      with a single a few specific purposes in mind. Without any physical altering
      these machines will only perform the tasks they were made to do. But a computer is designed to be able to do almost anything the user desires, so long as the user can write a program that gives the computer a very specific sequence of instructions.

      This specific sequence of instructions is mostly what we refer to as a computer program. The programs allow us to get the computer to perform the tasks we want. Ranging from web browsers and games to text editors or even print statements are all examples of computer programs.
    </p>

      These programs take a form of written communication or, programming language, and often hands it to an 'interpreter' which then translates it so the computer can understand and execute the instructions.

      Python is a programming language that also has an interpreter. Interpreters take the code programmers write using the python language and turns it into a form which the computer can understand and follow. When you code in Python you hit 'run' and the Python interpreter converts the code you wrote and sends it to the computer and the computer (hopefully) performs the task(s) specified.

      Just like human languages, programming languages have a form of grammar.

      Human languages have grammar that dictates what is correct or incorrect usage of the language. Programming languages essentially have the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dealing with humans however, context can come into play and people can usually figure it out even if the grammar isnt correct. But a computer, can not. So programmers have to write exact code in perfect 'grammar' in order for the computer to understand.

  <div class="concept" id="lesson5-1">
    <div class="concept-title">Variables in Python</div>
    <span class="concept-desc"> Variables are very useful tools</span>
    <p>
      In Python, variables are like little containers that hold values inside them. These values can be manipulated or swapped out without changing the name of the variable itself.
    </p>
    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="flex-item">my_var = 5</div>
      <div class="flex-item">This puts the value of 5 inside the variable my_var</div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="flex-item">my_var = 'cheese'</div>
      <div class="flex-item">This puts the word cheese in the variable my_var </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="concept" id="lesson5-2">
    <div class="concept-title">Assigning Values to Variables</div>
    <span class="concept-desc">Variables are representatives of values, and as such must be assigned a value to hold</span>
    <p>
      A variable must be assigned a value to hold, this value can be a number or a string of letters/words. It can even be assigned the result of an expression.
    </p>
    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="flex-item">my_var = 5 <br> my_var = 'cheese'</div>
      <div class="flex-item">my_var = 5 + 7 - 2 <br> my_var = 'cheese' + 'fries'</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The examples on the right would give the value of 10 to my_var or assign the word cheesefries to the variable.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept" id="lesson5-3">
    <div class="concept-title">The = in Math vs in Python</div>
    <span class="concept-desc">Whether if its being used in programming or in math, the = has a slightly different meaning.</span>
    <p>
      In math, the = typically means one side of the sign, is the same as the otherside of the sign. In programming it simply means the item on the left is going to represent whatever the value or resulting value is on the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      If approached mathematically, lets say my_var = 5, then further down the line we say my_var = 7, well 5 is not the same as 7 so this does not make any sense. In the programming world this mean the my_var is dropping the value of 5 and taking in the new value of 7.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, further down if we added my_var = my_var + 3, the new value of my_var would be 10, since we are taking the previous value my_var once held, 7, adding 3 to it and replacing the value in my_var with this result.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="concept" id="lesson5-4">
    <div class="concept-title">How Variables are Useful</div>
    <span class="concept-desc">Variables are extremely useful to programmers in many various ways.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>They improve code readability by allowing programmers to use names for values that make sense to humans.</li>
      <li>They give a way to store data and recall it easily.</li>
      <li>Allows for data to be manipulated but still have the same name.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="concept" id="lesson5-5">
    <div class="concept-title">Strings vs Numbers</div>
    <span class="concept-desc">Variables can be assigned either a string or a number.</span>
    <p>
      In Python, 2 is not the same thing as '2' or "2". 2 is number and can be treated as such, meaning it can be added to or subracted from or have ther numbers add to it. But '2' and "2" are both what we call, strings. These strings represent alphabetic values rather than numeric and can be a single letter, a sentence, or a whole paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      So while print 2 + 2 will print the number 4, print '2' + '2' will print the number 22. Just like print 'cheese' + 'fries' will print the word cheesefries.

      Functions are basically very small, typically single-purpose, programs that developers can create and use to perform procedures or methods without having to rewrite the code that the function contains, each time they use it.

    <span class="concept-desc">Functions can both be created and used by programmers</span>
    <p>
      When creating a function, a programmer must first define what it is (name and procedure it will perform) and what it needs (input/arguments/operands). After defining what a function needs and what it does with what it is given, it can be callled upon to perform its task anytime needed so long it is given the proper input.

    <div class="concept-title">The Importance of Return Statements</div>
    <span class="concept-desc">Input and procedures to perform are not enough for a function to be useful.</span>
    <p>
      As well as needing arguments to perform its task, a function also needs a return statement in order to make its work have any result and to make its existance worthwhile. A function can perform a procedure perfectly, but without a return statement to give the output of its work, it will never have an effect on what it was called upon do.

            <span class="concept-desc"></span>
            <p>
            Boolean values are essentially just, True or False. If using the code: print True or False. The python interpreter checks to see if the first expression is true, if so, it stops there and prints True. If we did: print False or True, the interpreter checks the first expression, being false, it will continue to the next expression. Sine the next expression is true, it will print True.

            <div class="concept-title" id="lesson7-2">If Statements</div>
            <span class="concept-desc"></span>
            <p>
            An If statement is a way to run a block of code as long as the stated text expression's value is True. If the test expression is False then it will skip the code contained within the If.<br><br>
            if &lttest expresson>:<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltcode block><br>
            <br>
            If statements typically use comparisons to determine if their code should be ran.(&lt, >, ==, !=, &lt=, >=)<br>

            a = 0<br>
            if a < 10:<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspprint a<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspa = a + 1<br>
            <br>
            The above if statement will run so long as the variable 'a' is smaller than 10. Inside the code it prints the value of 'a' then adds 1 to it and the interpreter is sent back to the begining of the if statement. One the value of 'a' reaches 10, 10 is not less than 10 so the interpreter now skips over the code inside the if.

            <span class="concept-desc"></span>
            <p>
            If statements can also have multiple test expressions connect with an or statement. By using or, the interpreter will determine whether or not to run the code in an if, so long as one of the test expressions is True.<br>
            age = 30<br>
            <br>
            if age < 20 or age == 30:<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltcode><br>
            <br>
            The example above would send the interpreter through the if block as long as the variable 'age' is under 20 or if it is equal to 30. It will check if the first expression is true. Since 30 is not less than 20, it goes to the next expression after the or, since 30 is in fact equal to 30, it will send the interpreter through the block.

            <p>
            While loops are blocks of code that are repeatedly run so long as the test expression continues to be true; once false, the interpreter jumps out of the while loop and proceeds with the rest of the code. <br>
            a = 0<br>
            while a < 10:<br>

            <p>
            A break statement ejects the interpreter from the loop it is currently in. Its the same thing as when the test expression is false, the interpreter skips over the code in the loop and continues with the rest of the program. A break statement is simply a way to force this to happen.

            <p>
            Sometimes loops can hit a point where the text expression will never be false and it will continue to run forever. Sometimes this can be intentional like you want a loop to infinitely loop until a specific condition is met at which you can insert a break statement. Mostly however, an infinite loop is a result of an error in code. It could be the counter variable isn't being incremented at the end of the loop therefore the loop will run forever.

            A lot of times the first time through, your code may not work properly or at all. This is where debugging comes into play. Debugging is the systematic, search and destroy type method of eliminatiing errors in code.

            Using print statements at various points of the program can show you whats going on behind the scenes of a program and let you know if what your intending your code to do as actually happening they way you meant for it to happen. These print statements can help you find where in your program things aren't going right and help you to solve the problem

            <p>
            Lists are strutctured data types that hold a 'list' of variables which can include both integers and strings as well as other lists.

            <span class="concept-desc"></span>
            <p>
            One of the differences between a list and a string is that a list can be manipulated through mutation, meaning that the list's values can be changed rather than reassigning a whole new value to the variable representing it.<br>
            This assigns the value 5 to the variable a:
            a = 5<br>
            This replaces the value assigned to a with a whole new value that is the result of its old held value + 5<br>
            a = a + 5<br>
            The append() function is an example of mutation, it adds a single entry to the end of a list, essentially changing the value of the list without reassigning the entire variable.<br>
            mylist.append(5) if previously mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4], it would now be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. If we then did: mylist.append([6, 7, 8]) mylist would then be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, [6, 7, 8]] because append only adds one entry but it does not reassign any of the values held in the other slots.

            <p>
            Lists can also be aliased, This is handy when you need a function to modify the values of a list that exists outside the function itself. Aliasing works much like it does with superheroes, Batman and Bruce Wayne are two identities for the same person. What happens to Batman also happens to Bruce Wayne.

            <p>
            For loops are especially useful when working with lists. A for loops is a loop that will perform it's block of code for every slot in the list and break out of this loop once it reaches the end of the entries in the list. Very useful when cycling through list and arrays.

            <p>
            Index is a built in function that finds the location of a specified value within a list and returns the location number where it was found. If said value is not found, it produces an error. <em>in</em> checks inside a list to see if a specified value is present, and returns a boolean value. On the same side other hand, you could use <em>not in</em> to make sure a value is not found within a list.

            <p>
            Sometimes there are some steps that need to be taken before code is written, a programmer has to know how they are going to solve the problem before the start coding. First step is Don't Panic, next ask: What is the problem? What are the inputs? What are the outputs?  Then work through some examples by hand to try and figure out how to get the outputs from the inputs using pseuo code. Pseudo code is kind of like writing in programming languages in a very vague and general way. Syntax usage isnt exact but one writes pseudo code using the same concepts as programming. Try to use simple mechanical solutions and once you start coding, develop your code incrementally using small functions and test them as you go.

            <span class="concept-desc"></span>
            <p>
            A really good way to make sure your code will work correctly is to be defensive, have checks in place to make sure the inputs are even valid inputs and use assertions to test your functions as you write them. An assertion is a check to see if a function's output is what you expect it to be. The line of code below shows an example of making sure that the function daysBetweenDates() returns the value it should return for the case given:<br>
            assert daysBetweenDates(2013, 1, 1, 2013, 1, 1) == 0<br>
            If this assertion is not true, it stops the program and throws an error while compiling. This makes it easier to search for and destroy bugs within your code.
