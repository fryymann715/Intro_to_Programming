Modulus Operator

The modulus operator % basically asks for the remainder from the division of two numbers.

15 % 12 results in 3 because 12 goes into 15 one time but leaves a difference of three betwwen
the two numbers.

4 % 3 = 1
15 % 11 = 4
25 % 4 = 1 

The last one is because 4 goes into 25 six times, 24, leaving a remainder of 1.



Dictionaries

A dictionary is similar to a list and an array. A dictionary is created either in an assignment or
using the dict() function.

Dictionaries have two values per entry, a key and the value that key represents (key value pairs)
and they can be affected by mutation.

elements = {}
